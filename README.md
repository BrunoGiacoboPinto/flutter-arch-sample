## Flutter Architecture Sample

A Simple Flutter project to explore architectural concepts.

### Project Goals

In order for code to scale and to be maintainable, a software project must have a well-defined

This project main goals, henceforth, are to test several architectural approaches and compare them in order to support a healthy technical discussion.

### Android Architectural Guideline Approach

One possibile first approach to architecture a Flutter application is to try to translate Google`s [Android Architectural Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) concepts to Flutter concepts.
